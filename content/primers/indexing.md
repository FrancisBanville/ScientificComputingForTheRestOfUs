The overwhelming majority of data we will need to manipulate will be stored in
vectors, or matrices, or other types of multi-dimensional structures.

````julia

  r â‰¥ 1/3 || continue
  println(round(r; digits=2))
end

In short, `continue` will *skip ahead* to the next element in the iteration.
This can be very important to avoid performing operations on objects that are
not relevant.
