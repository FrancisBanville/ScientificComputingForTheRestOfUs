# Machine learning capstones

These capstone lessons are meant to be followed after going through the [main
content](/lessons/). They have been developed specifically for an intensive
workshop organized jointly by **TBA**, **TBA**, and **TBA**, and consist of
short modules presenting ways to implement various learning algorithms in
*Julia*. They provide a few package-specific implementations.
