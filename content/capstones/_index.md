# Capstone lessons

The goal of these lessons is to see how the topics covered in the [main
lessons](/lessons) can be integrated. It is recommended to go through them
*after* having done the lessons. Capstones are designed to be shorter, and will
present some real-life applications of the principles covered in the main
lessons.
