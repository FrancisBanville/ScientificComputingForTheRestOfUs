# Capstone lessons

The goal of these lessons is to see how the concepts covered in the [main
lessons](/lessons) can be integrated. It is recommended to go through them
*after* having done the lessons. Capstones are designed to be shorter, and will
present some real-life applications of the principles covered in the main
lessons.

Capstone lessons present more advanced material, which may take a bit longer to
grasp. We encourage you to try them one at a time, and to come back to them over
the course of a few days.
